## Plugin Functions
For detailed informations read [this](https://github.com/CHR15cs/CS2-Practice-Plugin/wiki)<br>
### Match
Can be enabled via **.menu** or **.match**.<br>
Supports basic administration functionalities.<br>
To see everything this modes supports, visit the [wiki](https://github.com/CHR15cs/CS2-Practice-Plugin/wiki/Match-Commands)<br>
### Practice
Can be enabled via **.menu** or **.pracc**.<br>
Supports many helpful practice functions such as **.spawn (x)** where x is the spawn number.<br>
Grenade practice was a main topic for me, so I implemented a small **.nades** menu, where lineups are stored which can be saved with **.save (grenade title without whitespaces!)**.<br>
Detailed information can be found [here](https://github.com/CHR15cs/CS2-Practice-Plugin/wiki/Practice-Commands).<br>
### DryRun
Can be enabled via **.menu** or **.dryrun**.<br>
Is based on the match mode. But this supports addidtional commands, see [here](https://github.com/CHR15cs/CS2-Practice-Plugin/wiki/DryRun-Commands).
### Retake
Can be enabled via **.menu** or **.retake**.<br>
**THIS MODE STILL NEEDS ALOT OF WORK!**<br>
Use .edit to edit spawns for each site. Add spawns for your current team by using .addspawna for A site or .addspawnb to add the spawn for the b site.<br>
To delete spawns, you need to edit the spawn file. See the wiki for more.<br>
### Prefire
Can be enabled via **.menu** or **.prefire**.<br>
**THIS MODE STILL NEEDS ALOT OF WORK!**<br>
