### Practice
Can be enabled via **.menu** or **.pracc**.<br>
Supports many helpful practice functions such as **.spawn (x)** where x is the spawn number.<br>
Grenade practice was a main topic for me, so I implemented a small **.nades** menu, where lineups are stored which can be saved with **.save (grenade title without whitespaces!)**.<br>
